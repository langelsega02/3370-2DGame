# 3370-2DGame

Game definition:
Premises (mario wants to save the princess, Link wants to save Hyrule) basically just deciding our idea
Characters (Master chief is the hope for humanity, the vault dweller wanders around searching for a chip) basically describing our characters
Actions and Consequences (If mario picks a star he becomes invincible, you need to fire spaceships to prevent them to reach the bottom of the screen)
The base of the 2D game already in the repo
